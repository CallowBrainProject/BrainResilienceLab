# Resilience Brain Laboratory

Welcome to the Resilience Brain Lab at [Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine].

We study how physical activity and sleep contribute to cognitive resilience in aging and Alzheimer's disease, and how advanced neuroimaging measures may provide information on the underlying mechanisms of these relationships.

## Areas of Research
- Physical Activity
- Sleep
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
- Amyloid and Tau PET Imaging
- Cognitive Reserve and Cognitive Resilience
